  Hello, my name is Felix and I am thrilled to welcome you to my personal webpage!

  I am a computer science student studying at University of Waterloo, with 1 year of work experience in the field. Throughout my career, I have developed a passion for developing solutions and transfering ideas to the screen and have gained extensive knowledge and skills in this area.

  Aside from my professional pursuits, I also enjoy working out and reading to fulfill my curiosities. I find that engaging in these activities helps me to maintain a healthy work-life balance and provides me with a creative outlet.

  I hope that this webpage gives you a better understanding of who I am, and what I have to offer. Thank you for taking the time to visit, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
